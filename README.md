# OOP_Pointgiving1_2024

This assignment is NOT mandatory but might provide an
advantage for the final exam. There are no possible drawbacks
from completing the assignment. You can only gain points
not lose any.

The tasks for this assignment can be located within the
numbered task folders. You will be working with the
Program.cs files within each task folder.

In the Program.cs files you will see a task description
and a space marked for you to write your solution 
within (There is no limit on the amount of lines of code
you can write!).
If you want to check wether your solution is correct, 
you can push it to GitLab to have it tested*.

*this needs to be confirmed possible with the Scaleable Teaching project.
